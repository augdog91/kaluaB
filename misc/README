This directory can contain any extra source and text files,
which are not required to run the game.

The files won't be committed into source control repository and
won't be packaged for deployment.
It can contains notes, docs, tools, tests, data files, etc...

Todo:
-Figure out sprites
-Card img
-Make a die
-sql deck info
-make two decks (bonus and global/local)
-if card requires a die roll, make value 7, and replace with die roll when checked
-keep track of held player cards for amulets/temples
-implement sequence for avoiding/doubling global effects (apply card twice?)
-make families
-game log data
-player scores? The column player_score from the player table is automatically loaded into this.scoreCtrl and therefore into the stars location on the player board. This occurs sometime after the game setup() function. However this score must be updated as the game progresses using notifications.
